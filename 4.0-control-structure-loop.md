# 🔁 LOOPING STATEMENTS IN JAVASCRIPT

## ✅ WHAT ARE LOOPS?

Loops are **control structures** used to **execute a block of code repeatedly** as long as a specified condition is true. This helps avoid repeating code manually.

---

## 🔄 TYPES OF LOOPS IN JAVASCRIPT:

1. `for` loop
2. `while` loop
3. `do...while` loop

---

## 1. 🔁 `for` LOOP

### ✅ Syntax:

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // code block to run
}
```

### ✅ Explanation:

* **Initialization** – runs once before the loop starts.
* **Condition** – checked before each iteration; loop continues while it’s `true`.
* **Increment/Decrement** – updates the loop variable after every iteration.

---

### ✅ Example 1: Print numbers 1 to 5

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Number: " + i);
}

### 🔍 Under the Hood:

1. **Initialization:** `let i = 1` – A loop counter variable `i` is created and set to 1.
2. **Condition Check:** `i <= 5` – Since 1 ≤ 5 → `true`, it enters the loop.
3. **Inside Loop:** Executes `console.log("Number: " + i)` → prints `Number: 1`.
4. **Increment:** `i++` → i becomes 2.
5. Repeat steps 2–4 until `i` becomes 6 → `i <= 5` is `false`, loop exits.

```

---

### ✅ Example 2: Ask user to enter their name 3 times

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  let name = prompt("Enter your name (attempt " + i + "):");
  console.log("You entered: " + name);
}
```

1. Loop starts with `i = 1`.
2. Prompt is shown: “Enter your name (attempt 1):”
3. User types their name → stored in `name`.
4. `console.log()` prints what the user typed.
5. `i++` → becomes 2 → condition still true.
6. Continues until `i` becomes 4 → loop ends.

---

### ✅ Example 3: Sum of numbers 1 to 5

```javascript
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  sum += i;
}
console.log("Sum is: " + sum); // 15
```

1. `sum` is initialized to 0.
2. `i = 1`, adds to `sum` → `sum = 1`
3. `i = 2`, sum = 1 + 2 = 3
4. Continues: sum = 6, then 10, then 15
5. `i = 6` → loop exits
6. Final result `console.log("Sum is: 15")` is printed
---

### ✅ Example 4: Grading Multiple Students

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  let score = prompt("Enter score for student " + i + ":");
  score = Number(score);
  let grade;

  if (score >= 70) grade = 'A';
  else if (score >= 60) grade = 'B';
  else if (score >= 50) grade = 'C';
  else if (score >= 40) grade = 'D';
  else grade = 'F';

  alert("Student " + i + " scored " + score + ", Grade: " + grade);
}


### 🔍 Under the Hood:

1. Loop from 1 to 3 → 3 students.
2. Each time:

   * Prompt asks for score
   * `score` is converted to number
   * Uses `if...else` to check:

     * If score ≥ 70 → 'A'
     * Else if ≥ 60 → 'B', etc.
3. Alert shows result with student number and grade.
```

---

## 2. 🔁 `while` LOOP

### ✅ Syntax:

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // code block to run
}
```

### ✅ Explanation:

* Executes the block **while** the condition is `true`.
* The condition is checked **before** the block runs.

---

### ✅ Example 1: Ask until correct password

```javascript
let password = "";
while (password !== "admin123") {
  password = prompt("Enter password:");
  if (password !== "admin123") {
    alert("Wrong password, try again.");
  }
}
alert("Access granted!");

### 🔍 Under the Hood:

1. `password = ""` – initially wrong.
2. Condition: `password !== "admin123"` is `true` → enters loop.
3. Prompts user to enter password.
4. If wrong again, shows alert.
5. Repeats until the user types "admin123".
6. Once correct, condition becomes false → loop exits.
7. Final alert shows "Access granted!"
```


---

### ✅ Example 2: Print numbers 1 to 5

```javascript
let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
  console.log("Count: " + i);
  i++;
}


### 🔍 Under the Hood:

1. Starts with `i = 1`
2. Checks `i <= 5` → true
3. Prints → increases `i` by 1
4. When `i = 6`, loop stops

```

---

### ✅ Example 3: Ask user until they type "stop"

```javascript
let input = "";
while (input !== "stop") {
  input = prompt("Type 'stop' to end:");
  console.log("You typed: " + input);
}
alert("Loop ended.");

### 🔍 Under the Hood:

1. Starts with empty `input`
2. User types something → stored in `input`
3. If not `"stop"`, repeats prompt
4. Once user types `"stop"`, condition fails → loop ends

```

---

## 3. 🔁 `do...while` LOOP

### ✅ Syntax:

```javascript
do {
  // code block to run
} while (condition);
```

### ✅ Explanation:

* Runs the code block **once** before checking the condition.
* Then continues if the condition is `true`.

---

### ✅ Example 1: Enter positive number at least once

```javascript
let number;
do {
  number = Number(prompt("Enter a positive number:"));
} while (number <= 0);
alert("You entered: " + number);

### 🔍 Under the Hood:

1. Runs block once, no matter what.
2. Prompts user → converts input to number
3. If number ≤ 0, repeats
4. When user enters positive number, loop stops

```

---

### ✅ Example 2: Greet the user 3 times

```javascript
let count = 1;
do {
  console.log("Hello user! Count: " + count);
  count++;
} while (count <= 3);


### 🔍 Under the Hood:

1. Starts with `count = 1`
2. Prints greeting, increments
3. Stops when `count` becomes 4

```

---

### ✅ Example 3: Add numbers until total is above 50

```javascript
let total = 0;
do {
  let num = Number(prompt("Enter a number to add:"));
  total += num;
  console.log("Current total: " + total);
} while (total <= 50);

alert("Total exceeded 50. Final total: " + total);


1. `total = 0`
2. Prompts user to enter a number
3. Adds to total and logs
4. Repeats while `total <= 50`
5. When total exceeds 50 → exits and alerts final value

```

---

## 🛑 BRANCHING INSIDE LOOPS

You can use these inside loops:

* `break` – exits the loop early
* `continue` – skips current iteration and goes to the next

---

### ✅ Example with `break`: Stop if number is negative

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  let num = Number(prompt("Enter a number:"));
  if (num < 0) {
    alert("Negative number entered. Stopping loop.");
    break;
  }
  console.log("You entered: " + num);
}

### 🔍 Under the Hood:

1. Loop begins → asks for number
2. If number is negative → alert is shown
3. `break` stops the entire loop
4. If not, logs the number and continues

```

---

### ✅ Example with `continue`: Skip odd numbers

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 !== 0) {
    continue;
  }
  console.log("Even number: " + i);
}

### 🔍 Under the Hood:

1. Loop runs from 1 to 10
2. `i % 2 !== 0` means odd number
3. If it's odd → `continue` skips to next iteration
4. If it's even → logs it

```

---

## 🧠 ASSIGNMENTS

1. Ask user to enter 5 names using a `for` loop and print them with numbering.
2. Use a `while` loop to ask the user for a number until they enter one greater than 100.
3. Use a `do...while` loop to keep adding numbers until the total is more than 200.
4. Ask user to enter 3 scores, then print each score and its corresponding grade (`A`, `B`, etc).
5. Using a `for` loop, print the multiplication table of 5.
